\section{Introduction}

This document contains a mix of theory, describing the workings of certain 
aspects of western music, and code which describes a way to utilize the
theory to automatically generate accompaniments for musical scores. 

\section{The basics}
First things first, what is a musical score? A musical score is basically
music in printed form, the characteristic sheet of music is a musical score. 
The rules that govern how such scores are interpreted are quite complex 
and only a subset of them will be described and utilized here. For the 
purpose of this document however a musical score consists of notes
and chords. The chord symbols are written above the lines wherein the notes 
lie and consist of, at least in this document, one of the letters C,D,E,F,G,A.

\subsection{Notes}

Which naturally leads to the next topic, what does C,D,E... represent? To
answer that it helps to first answer a more basic question and that is: What
is the relationship between a note and an actual physical sound? It must
somehow relate to the frequency of the sound, since different frequencys are
basically different sounds (although other factors, souch as volume, 
instrument etc. also play a role). 

The way notes works is that they belong to different frequency sections 
called octaves, where octave 1 is the lowest found on pianos. So for a 
note to make sense it needs to be accompanied with its octave, e.g. 
Note $\in$ (C, 4) which denotes a C in the fourth octave. The letters C - A 
then represent different positions within an octave, called semitones,
and each octave is divided into twelve semitones. In this document the
distance between semitones is assumed to be equal.

Another import quality of octaves is that the frequency range they
represent double between each octave, where the first octave has an 
approximate frequenzy range of 30 to 60 hz. The highest octave 
represented on a piano is typically the seventh.  

To reiterate then, C,D,E,.. represent one position on an equidistant 
frequency scale, with twelve positions called semitones. To use that 
informatation to construct a sound we also need an octave, which is 
basically a multiple of octaves. So, given a positon and an octave we
have physical sound frequency, and to construct a sound from that all
we need is a duration, an instrument and a volume. Here the convention
is to call the combination of position in an octave and an octave a 
\emph{pitch}, the position is called a PitchClass in Haskore. The duration
is defined as ratio of whole note (<= 1), and the default value in 
Haskore is 30 whole notes per minute. Thus:

\begin{verbatim}

	>type Pitch = (PitchClass, Octave)
	>type PitchClass = C | D | E..
	>type Note = Pitch -> Dur -> [NoteAttribute] -> Music
	>:t Volume 
	Volume :: Float -> NoteAttribute
	>type Dur = Ration Int
	>:t wn 
	>wn :: Dur
	>:t (Note (G,4) wn [Volume 60])
	> (Note (G,4) wn [Volume 60]) :: Music

\end{verbatim}

\section{Keys and chords}

\subsection{Note supplies, patterns, harmonic qualities}

So how do we interpret a note sheet? An important concept is that of note 
supplies. As a rule only a subset of the pitchclasses are used in a song,
this subset is called the note supply for the piece and it is from these
pitchclasses that the Pitches in a melody are formed. To construct the 
note supple for a piece its key is needed, which is an object with two
properties - a root, which is a pitchclass, and a harmonic quality, which 
is either major or minor. Thus (C,Major) is a Key.

In this document this key is used in two ways to construct the note supply. 
First its harmonic quality is used to choose a pattern, basically positions
in an octave, and its root is used to align the pattern so that the note
supply starts at this section of the octave. There are several different
patterns to choose from for both major and minor, in this assignement
only the most common for major and minor are used and they are called
ionian and aeolian respectively (see below). Furthermore the note supply
also needs an octave to represent a set of unique pitches, in this assignement
the melody is played with this octave set to four. This leads us to construct
the following types and definitions.

\begin{verbatim}

> data HarmonicQuality = Major | Minor
>	deriving (Eq)
> type Key = (PitchClass,HarmonicQuality)
> type ScalePattern = [Int]
> ionian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, dorian, phrygian :: ScalePattern
> ionian	= [0, 2, 4, 5, 7 ,9, 11]
> lydian	= [0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 ,11]
> mixolydian	= [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]
> aeolian	= [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]
> dorian	= [0, 2, 3, 5 ,7, 9, 10]
> phrygian	= [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]

> noteSupply :: Pitch -> HarmonicQuality -> [AbsPitch]
> noteSupply pitch quality 
>	| quality == Major = map ((+) (absPitch pitch)) ionian
>	| quality == Minor = map ((+) (absPitch pitch)) aeolian

\end{verbatim}

So given a note supply pitches for the notes on the note sheet are constructed
from this supply by looking at their position in the sheet. The note that
starts two steps below the bottom line in the sheet is the first in the note 
supply and every subsequent step is are choosen from the pattern íncrementally.


\subsection{Chordprogressions, chord scales}
Having found a way to construct a melody from the note sheet we now turn to
the chords. The cord symbols are, as mentioned above, the series of letters
written above the lines in the note sheet. This series of letters is called
the chord progression. We are interested in constructing two things from the 
chord progression, basslines and chord voicing. The chord voicing consists
of chords, and cords are three notes played at the same time, in this 
assignement only three are used in a chord. This series of chords is 
constructed from the chord progression. The bassline consists of a series
notes constructed from a bassstyle, defined below, and the chord progression.
However we need to cover some more properties of chords before we can go on.
we only play three. To do that we first need to cover some properties of chords.


The chord symbols represent chord classes which is a concept similiar
to that of keys. A chord class has a root, which is the symbol itself,
a harmonic, and a pattern. These properties then map to notes that in
a musical sense belong to each other . The pattern is used to find
the chord scale, which is a set of notes from which chords and basslines
are constructed. The pattern is found by: 
1 - Find the root of the chord class as the chord symbol itself
2 - Find the position of the pitchclass represented by the root of
the chord class in the note supply of the melody.
3 - Use the position and the harmonic of the chord class and find the
corresponding pattern from a list (see below for the list itself). 
The chord scale is then simply constructed by applying the pattern
to the root of the chord class. Given these rules we construct
the following:

\begin{verbatim}

> type ChordProgression = [(PitchClass,Dur)]

> chooseScalePattern :: HarmonicQuality -> Int -> ScalePattern
> chooseScalePattern quality 
>	| quality == Major = chooseScalePatternMajor
>	| quality == Minor = chooseScalePatternMinor
>	where
>		chooseScalePatternMajor pos
>			| pos == 0 = ionian
>			| pos == 1 = mixolydian
>			| pos == 3 = lydian
>			| pos == 4 = mixolydian
>			| pos == 5 = aeolian
> 		chooseScalePatternMinor pos
>			| pos == 1 = dorian
>			| pos == 2 = phrygian

> -- We're intrested in the position of a pitchclass
> -- in a list of Pitches. It's easier to convert each 
> -- pitch to an abspitch (octave*12 + pos pitchclass)
> -- and then only work the the positions of the elements
> -- in the zeroth octave (thus, use modulo 12)
> notePosition :: [AbsPitch] -> AbsPitch -> Int
> notePosition scale ab = pos (map (`mod` 12) scale) ab 0

> -- Short help function, find index of element in a list
> pos :: Eq a => [a] -> a -> Int -> Int
> pos [] _ i = i 			
> pos (x:xs) xr i 
>	| x == xr = i
>	| x /= xr = pos xs xr (i+1)

\end{verbatim}


================================================================================
\section{Bassline}
The bassline is constructed by looking at the chord classes in the chord 
progression and their chord scales. These scales are then sampled using a bass 
style, in this assignement we use three different bass styles - basic, boogie 
and calypso. 

However we also need durations for the notes that we construct and they are 
found by looking at another piece of information on the note sheet. The 
horisontal lines are chopped of by vertical lines at regular intervals. Each 
such interval is called a bar and consist a whole note. Therefore the bass styles 
are given as a series of sample positions and corresponding durations, where the
durations add up to a whole note. For example the basic bass style consists of 
half note sample of position one in the chord scale, and a half note sample of 
position five. This leads us to define the following code:

\begin{verbatim}

> silence = -1 -- Used for bass styles with silent elements.
> -- Handled in a special way when the notes are constructed. 

> type BassStyle = [(Int,Dur)]
> basic, calypso, boogie :: BassStyle
> basic = [(0,hn),(4,hn)]
> calypso = [(silence,qn),(0,en),(2,en),(silence,qn),(0,en),(2,en)]
> boogie = [(0,en),(4,en),(5,en),(4,en),
>	(0,en),(4,en),(5,en),(4,en)]

\end{verbatim}

A problem with this approach though is if two chord symbols appear in the same 
bar. This is simply solved by playing the first half of the bassline for the 
first symbol, and the first half for the other aswell.
